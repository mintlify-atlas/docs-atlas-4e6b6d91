## Welcome to Broccoli

Broccoli is a robust message queue system for Rust applications, designed as a Rust alternative to [Celery](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/getting-started/introduction.html). If you're familiar with Celery but want to leverage Rust's performance and type safety, Broccoli is your answer.

<Note>
  Broccoli is actively under development. We're working hard to make it production-ready and would love your feedback and contributions!

## Why Broccoli?

Broccoli brings the simplicity and flexibility of Celery to the Rust ecosystem:

- **Performance** - Rust's zero-cost abstractions and memory safety without garbage collection
- **Type safety** - Catch errors at compile time with strongly typed messages
- **Async-first** - Built on Tokio for efficient concurrent message processing
- **Flexible** - Support for multiple brokers with a consistent API
- **Production-ready** - Connection pooling, retry strategies, and error handling built-in

## Community and support

Broccoli is an open-source project and we welcome contributions:

- Report issues on [GitHub](https://github.com/densumesh/broccoli/issues)
- Contribute new broker implementations
- Improve documentation
- Share your use cases and feedback

Let's build something great together!
